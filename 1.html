                <h1>ASP.NET</h1>

                <p>ASP.NET is a powerful web development framework created by Microsoft for building dynamic, scalable,
                    and secure web applications. It is part of the .NET platform and supports multiple programming
                    languages, including C# and Visual Basic. ASP.NET is widely used for creating websites, web APIs,
                    and real-time applications.</p>

                <h1>PHP</h1>

                <p>PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. Originally created by
                    Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into a robust language for building dynamic and interactive
                    web applications. It is especially suited for web-based tasks like handling forms, interacting with
                    databases, and managing session data.</p>

                    Sun Microsystems in 1995. Known for its portability, robustness, and simplicity, Java is widely used
                    in various applications, from desktop and mobile to enterprise systems and large-scale distributed
